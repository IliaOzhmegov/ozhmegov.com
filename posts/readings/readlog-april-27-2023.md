Back in 2019, I used to keep a log of all the articles and posts I read on a 
daily basis. However, over time, I lost track of my reading habit and 
struggled to find and recall the information I had previously read. Recently, 
I decided to revive this daily ritual and start keeping track of my reading again.

I'm excited to kick off this new reading log with sources recommended by my 
good friend [Ben](https://benfeifke.com/). He's always been a valuable source 
of information and insights, and I'm eager to explore the articles he's 
suggested and share my thoughts on them.

<!-- TEASER_END -->

Through this reading log, I hope to not only stay organized and remember 
important information, but also share my perspective and engage with others 
who may have read the same articles. So without further ado, let's dive into 
the first set of articles on my reading log!

1. [**Write for Towards Data Science**](https://towardsdatascience.com/questions-96667b06af5#dee8): <br>
A nice and short post about why and how to submit written articles to "Towards 
Data Science". I will likely return to this one quite often.

1. [**I got 7 job offers during the worst job market in history. Hereâ€™s the data......**](http://www.jefflichronicles.com/blog/2020/9/26/i-got-7-job-offers-during-the-worst-job-market-in-history-heres-the-data): <br>
Although, I believe Jeff might be wrong regarding 2020 being the worst job 
market in history, he shares quite interesting observations and advice for
job searching. I will try to integrate his strategy into my approach.

I'm really pleased to be back!
