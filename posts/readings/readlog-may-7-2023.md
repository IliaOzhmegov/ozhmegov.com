## Longest Increasing Subsequence

Today, I encountered an interesting [**problem on LeetCode**](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-longest-valid-obstacle-course-at-each-position/) that required 
familiarity with the "Longest Increasing Subsequence" algorithm. Although my 
initial solution, which involved something similar to Monotonic Stack, was 
enough to pass the tests, I decided to explore the problem more deeply by 
requesting this subsequence for each element of the array.

The wiki page for 
[**Longest Increasing Subsequence - wiki**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longest_increasing_subsequence)
may provide a more complex explanation than 
needed for the LeetCode problem, but it can serve as a foundation for tackling 
more complex problems, which I used to solve.
