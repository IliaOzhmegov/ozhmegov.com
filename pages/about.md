Welcome to my blog! 

My name is Ilia Ozhmegov, and I am a data enthusiast and practitioner. 
I hold a Master's degree in Data Science and have over 5 years of experience 
in Data and SWE fields working in different domains starting from finance and 
ending up with robotics.

<!-- ![alt text](/images/me.jpeg "Title") -->

In addition to my work in data science and machine learning, I am also 
interested in data engineering and software engineering. I have over 7 years 
of experience with programming languages such as Rust, C++, and Python, and I 
enjoy exploring new technologies and frameworks.

One area of particular interest to me are distributed technologies such as 
Apache Spark and Apache Kafka. From my experience as Data And Analytics 
Engineer I have gained an empirical evidence of how these tools are crucial in 
meeting data needs of businesses. 

When I'm not working on data-related projects or writing blog posts, you can 
find me cycling on my bike, travelling to new places, or mastering new skills. 
I believe that it's important to have a well-rounded set of interests and 
hobbies outside of work, and I enjoy exploring new activities and learning new 
things.

Thank you for visiting my blog, and I hope you find my content helpful and 
informative. If you have any questions or comments, please don't hesitate to
