## Context

I have a Performance section on my blog where I focus on evaluating my 
self-improvement activities. I strongly believe that consistency is key to 
achieving any goal, and that consistency can be measured. At the beginning of 
this year, I decided to spend more time on conscious self-improvement by 
identifying my strengths and weaknesses, and working on them accordingly. 

To achieve this, I have divided my regular activities into several categories 
such as typing exercises, solving LeetCode problems, improving my Personalized 
Development Environment (PDE), learning new technologies or libraries, and 
studying professional literature. This section of my blog documents my daily 
efforts in this endless journey of self-improvement.

To do this, I've divided my daily activities into 11 categories, some of them
are:

* Typing
* Leetcode challenges and expanding my knowledge of data structures and algorithms
* Precise terminology and the ability to explain complex concepts simply
* Configuring my personalized development environment (PDE)
* Studying new technologies or libraries and keeping up with updates
* Reading specialized literature, such as the 2nd edition of "Fluent Python"
* Improving my foreign language skills
* Evaluating my performance and identifying areas for improvement

By organizing my activities into these categories and establishing clear
goals, I hope to maintain consistency in my efforts towards self-improvement 
and reflect on my progress in each area.

#### Heatmap

The heatmap above shows my consistency in each activity per week. To simplify 
the visualization, I have limited the density to a maximum of 4 hours. 
Although the majority of activities took more than 4 hours per week, they are truncated 
at the value of 4.

#### Bar chart

The bar plot displays the total time I spend on each activity, while the 
heatmap provides a visual representation of the consistency of my engagement 
in these activities throughout the week.
